		#DM_RFC_description = This elegantly simple fuel cell power generator that allows liquid fuel and intake air to be converted into consistent, stable power. This is a streamlined, radially attached version which makes a great addition to any space plane. Handy for those places where a solar panel will not do.  Also handy for re-heating snacks. Attempts to use in vacuum have summoned rather large, pesky and unwanted multi-tentacled creatures. // #DM-RFC_description = This elegantly simple fuel cell power generator that allows liquid fuel and intake air to be converted into consistent, stable power.

Attempts to use in vacuum have summoned rather large, pesky and unwanted multi-tentacled creatures. We've increased the size of the original aerodynamic fuel cell so we can combust more fuel at one time! // #DM-RFC_description = This elegantly simple fuel cell power generator that allows liquid fuel and intake air to be converted into consistent, stable power.
